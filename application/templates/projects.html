        <p><b>Objective:</b> How might I establish my personal brand? <br> <b>Skills:</b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, Flask, MongoDB, Bootstrap, Github, Web Development</p>
        <p>In August 2020, I used Flask to build this personal website. I learned so many new things, such as how CSS and JavaScript work with HTML, how to embed a Processing sketch, and how to connect a MongoDB database. My favorite part was designing and learning the front-end elements of this application.</p>

        <p><b>Objective:</b> How might I automate my internship? <br> <b>Skills:</b> Python, sklearn, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Machine Learning</p>
        <p>During the last week of my internship at Dell, I looked at the work being done everyday and came up with a program to cut down time for the team. I enjoyed diving into a new realm I was initially intimidated with, and managed to get 80% accuracy on my natural language text categorization program.</p>

        <p><b>Objective:</b> How might I gather data about Morning Brew's target audience? <br> <b>Skills:</b> Python, Tweepy, Jupyter Notebook</p>
        <p>During a group project for my Strategic Information Technologies course, I was tasked with creating a program that listens to the Twitter API stream for Morning Brew, a email newsletter company. My program listened to the top 5 locations with the most Morning Brew related tweets, and tracked hot topics. My group then provided strategic recommendations for the company.</p>

        <p><b>Objective:</b> How might we create a 2D side scroller game? <br> <b>Skills:</b> Java, Processing, Sprite Animation, Scene Hierarchy, OOP, Version Control</p>
        <p>My team and I created a 2D game where the player must jump over obstacles and defeat enemy characters to reach the end of the game. The player then receives a score, and will be prompted to enter a username for high-scores. We incorporated music, GUI buttons, and keyboard inputs. I headed the scene hierarchy and class structure of the game, and coded the classes for the landscape.</p>
